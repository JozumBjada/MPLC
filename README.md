# MPLC

MATLAB code that performs numerical simulations based on Multiplane-light-conversion (MPLC) technique as proposed in [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 27, 2524â€“2531 (2010)](https://opg.optica.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-27-11-2524). A set of phase masks and a free-space light propagation modelled by FFT are used in the optimization procedure. The input is the desired operation on modes of light. The output is a set of numerical arrays corresponding to the phase masks.
