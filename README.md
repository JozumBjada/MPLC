# MPLC

MATLAB code that performs numerical simulations based on Multiplane-light-conversion (MPLC) technique. A set of phase masks and a free-space light propagation modelled by FFT are used in the optimization procedure. The input is the desired operation on modes of light. The output is a set of numerical arrays corresponding to the phase masks.
